2010-12-13, Alembic 0.9.1:

Just a minor update to enable Alembic on 32-bit systems, along with
getting the code in examples/bin/AbcEcho reasonably working.

2010-12-08, Alembic 0.9.1:

The main things in this release are the addition of a Renderman procedural
plugin, and a bunch of bug fixes.  The example Maya exporter
(AlembicSimpleAbcExport) can be used to create an Alembic file from a Maya
scene, and that Alembic file can be read by the Renderman plugin to create
images, which means that an end-to-end workflow can be achieved.  A complete
overview of the changes to the code is here:

A summary of the bugs fixed in this change:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=71

An internal implementation detail that fixed an issue where files created by
the AlembicSimpleAbcExport Maya plugin were invalid.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=118

Another internal implementation bugfix that ensured that certain properties of
a subdivision surface were properly animatable.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=17

Method to return a Property's parent Object simply did not work.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=121

Methods to determine high-level type now more flexible and correct.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=7

Build system improvement; now behaves better when trying to find the Boost
headers and libraries.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=13

A consequence of the bug that was fixed in issue 71.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=123

Alembic was not reading all the required data from an ISimpleXform.


In progress, we have:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=102

This is an arbitrary transform "stack" type, roughly equivalent to Renderman's
transformation model.  It has per-operation hints that allow it to be
recognized as a transform and mapped directly to another application's
transformation model.  It can also be read and written as a regular 4x4
matrix.
